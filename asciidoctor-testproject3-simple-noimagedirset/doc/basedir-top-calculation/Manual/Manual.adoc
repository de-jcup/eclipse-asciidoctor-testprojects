Main text

var1 = {var1} (from included)

var2 = {var2} (from included)

image::tux.svg[]
Direct: expect not working, no imagesdir attribute set

image::img/tux.svg[]
Document relative path: WRONG! Should work as the images are in ./img/ directory relative to this file

image::Manual/img/tux.svg[]
Relative path from document's parent directory: WRONG! Why should I specify Manual/ directory? Is the "include" directive braking paths?
