= Variable include problem:{mysubtitle}

include::../ADocMeta.asc[]

The problem was the usage of 2 colons and an umlaut +
`:mysubtitle: : ü` inside ADocMeta.asc !

After change to
`:mysubtitle: ü` +
it worked well with ASP and native asciidoctor.


TIP: ü works well inside adoc element itself, works
